This list started as personal collection of interesting things about VTEX. At the time it started VTEX was in beta, there was special script to transform JSX to JS and even Flux was not yet published. VTEX is mainstream now, lots of things happened. Please, do not try to use this list as advertisement board or place for public push of your experiments. Only fully free resources here, please. Your contributions and suggestions are heartily♡ welcome, though. (✿◠‿◠)
